      This page was created to fill the void of me not being able to 
      find information on medals, vehicles, characters, maps, and things of
      that sort on a single website.

        When there is a void then the need to take up that void was a necessary 
        and enjoyable taks for me.  I hope to build this site out and excited 
        what the Halo universe future brings.  I hope this site serves as a handy
        place to grab Halo gaming information.
